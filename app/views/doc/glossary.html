<h3 id="application-package">Application package</h3>

<p>A package that is not intended to be used as a library. Application packages may
have <a href="#dependency">dependencies</a> on other packages, but are never depended on
themselves. They are usually meant to be run directly, either on the command
line or in a browser. The opposite of an application package is a <a href="#library-package">library
package</a>.</p>

<p>Application packages should check their <a href="#lockfile">lockfiles</a> into source
control, so that everyone working on the application and every location the
application is deployed has a consistent set of dependencies. Because their
dependencies are constrained by the lockfile, application packages usually
specify <code>any</code> for their dependencies&rsquo; <a href="#version-constraint">version
constraints</a>.</p>

<h3 id="asset">Asset</h3>

<p>A resource&mdash;Dart, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, image, or anything
else&mdash;intended to be part of a deployed package. The package can be a web
app, a package used by a web app, or any other package that benefits from a
build step. Tools such as <a href="pub-serve.html"><code>pub serve</code></a> and <a href="pub-
build.html"><code>pub build</code></a> take <em>source</em> assets (such as an HTML file, a CSS file, and
several Dart files) and produce <em>generated</em> assets (such as the same HTML and
CSS files, plus a single JavaScript file).</p>

<p>Assets fall into four groups, with some overlap:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source asset: An actual, authored file on disk that <code>pub build</code> and
<code>pub serve</code> can find and use.</li>
  <li>Generated asset: An asset (possibly the output of a
<a href="#transformer">transformer</a>) that&rsquo;s either served by <code>pub serve</code> or saved
to disk by <code>pub build</code>.</li>
  <li>Input asset: An asset that is the input to a transformer. An input asset
might be a source asset, or it might be the output of a transformer in a
previous phase.</li>
  <li>Output asset: An asset that is created by a transformer. An output asset
might be a generated asset, or it might be the input to a transformer in a
later phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, see
<a href="assets-and-transformers.html">Assets and Transformers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dependency">Dependency</h3>

<p>Another package that your package relies on. If your package wants to import
code from some other package, that package must be a dependency. Dependencies
are specified in your package&rsquo;s <a href="pubspec.html">pubspec</a> and described
<a href="dependencies.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Entrypoint</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Entrypoint&rdquo; is used to mean two things. In the general context of Dart, it is
a Dart library that is directly invoked by a Dart implementation. When you
reference a Dart library in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag or pass it as a command line
argument to the standalone Dart VM, that library is the entrypoint. In other
words, it&rsquo;s usually the <code>.dart</code> file that contains <code>main()</code>.</p>

<p>In the context of pub, an &ldquo;entrypoint package&rdquo; or &ldquo;root package&rdquo; is the root
of a dependency graph. It will usually be an application. When you run your app,
it&rsquo;s the entrypoint package. Every other package it depends on will not be an
entrypoint in that context.</p>

<p>A package can be an entrypoint in some contexts and not in others. Lets say your
app uses a library package A. When you run your app, A is not the entrypoint
package. However, if you go over to A and execute its unit tests, in that
context, it <em>is</em> the entrypoint since your app isn&rsquo;t involved.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint-directory">Entrypoint directory</h3>

<p>A directory inside your package that is allowed to contain
<a href="#entrypoint">Dart entrypoints</a>. Pub will ensure all of these directories get
a &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directory, which is needed for &ldquo;package:&rdquo; imports to work.</p>

<p>Pub has a whitelist of these directories: <code>benchmark</code>, <code>bin</code>, <code>example</code>,
<code>test</code>, <code>tool</code>, and <code>web</code>. Any subdirectories of those (except <code>bin</code>) may also
contain entrypoints.</p>

<h3 id="immediate-dependency">Immediate dependency</h3>

<p>A <a href="#dependency">dependency</a> that your package directly uses itself. The
dependencies you list in your pubspec are your package&rsquo;s immediate dependencies.
All other dependencies are <a href="#transitive-dependency">transitive dependencies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="library-package">Library package</h3>

<p>A package that other packages will depend on. Library packages may have
<a href="#dependency">dependencies</a> on other packages <em>and</em> may be dependencies
themselves. They may also include scripts that will be run directly. The
opposite of a library package is an <a href="#application-package">application package</a>.</p>

<p>Library packages should not check their <a href="#lockfile">lockfile</a> into source
control, since they should support a range of dependency versions. Their
<a href="#immediate-dependency">immediate dependencies</a>&rsquo; <a href="#version-constraints">version
constraints</a> should be as wide as possible while still
ensuring that the dependencies will be compatible with the versions that were
tested against.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a> requires that libraries increment
their major version numbers for any backwards incompatible changes, library
packages will usually require their dependencies&rsquo; versions to be greater than or
equal to the versions that were tested and less than the next major version. So
if your library depended on the (fictional) <code>transmogrify</code> package and you
tested it at version 1.2.1, your version constraint would be <code>"&gt;=1.2.1 &lt;2.0.0"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="lockfile">Lockfile</h3>

<p>A file named <code>pubspec.lock</code> that specifies the concrete versions and other
identifying information for every immediate and transitive dependency a package
relies on.</p>

<p>Unlike the pubspec, which only lists immediate dependencies and allows version
ranges, the lock file comprehensively pins down the entire dependency graph to
specific versions of packages. A lockfile ensures that you can recreate the
exact configuration of packages used by an application.</p>

<p>The lockfile is generated automatically for you by pub when you run
<a href="pub-get.html"><code>pub get</code></a> or <a href="pub-upgrade.html"><code>pub upgrade</code></a>. If your
package is an application package, you will typically check this into source
control. For library packages, you usually won&rsquo;t.</p>

<h3 id="sdk-constraint">SDK constraint</h3>

<p>The declared versions of the Dart SDK itself that a package declares that it
supports. An SDK constraint is specified using normal
<a href="#version-constraint">version constraint</a> syntax, but in a special &ldquo;environment&rdquo;
section <a href="pubspec.html#sdk-constraints">in the pubspec</a>.</p>

<h3 id="source">Source</h3>

<p>A kind of place that pub can get packages from. A source isn&rsquo;t a specific place
like pub.dartlang.org or some specific Git URL. Each source describes a general
procedure for accessing a package in some way. For example, &ldquo;git&rdquo; is one source.
The git source knows how to download packages given a Git URL. There are a few
different <a href="dependencies.html#sources">supported sources</a>.</p>

<h3 id="system-cache">System cache</h3>

<p>When pub gets a remote package, it downloads it into a single &ldquo;system cache&rdquo;
directory maintained by pub. When it generates a &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directory for a
package, that only contains symlinks to the real packages in the system cache.
On Mac and Linux, this directory defaults to <code>~/.pub-cache</code>. On Windows, it
goes in <code>AppData\Roaming\Pub\Cache</code>.</p>

<p>This means you only have to download a given version of a package once and can
then reuse it in as many packages as you would like. It also means you can
delete and regenerate your &ldquo;packages&rdquo; directory without having to access the
network.</p>

<h3 id="transformer">Transformer</h3>

<p>A transformer is a Dart object that converts input <a href="#asset">assets</a> (such as
Dart files or Polymer-formatted HTML) into output assets (such as JavaScript
and HTML). The <a href="pub-build.html"><code>pub build</code></a> command puts the generated assets
into files. The <a href="pub-serve.html"><code>pub serve</code></a> command, on the other hand,
doesn&rsquo;t produce files; its generated assets are served directly by the dev
server.</p>

<p>For more information, see
<a href="assets-and-transformers.html">Assets and Transformers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="transitive-dependency">Transitive dependency</h3>

<p>A dependency that your package indirectly uses because one of its dependencies
requires it. If your package depends on A, which in turn depends on B which
depends on C, then A is an <a href="#immediate-dependency">immediate dependency</a> and B
and C are transitive ones.</p>

<h3 id="uploader">Uploader</h3>

<p>An uploader of a package is someone who has administrative permissions
for that package. They can not only upload new versions of a package,
but also <a href="pub-uploader.html">add and remove other uploaders</a> for that
package. The uploader of a package is often, but not necessarily, the
same as the <a href="pubspec.html#authorauthors">author</a> of a package.</p>

<p>Anyone uploading a new package automatically becomes an uploader for
that package. Otherwise, to become an uploader, you need to contact an
existing uploader and ask them to add you as another uploader.</p>

<h3 id="version-constraint">Version constraint</h3>

<p>A constraint placed on each <a href="#dependency">dependency</a> of a package that
specifies which versions of that dependency the package is expected to work
with. This can be a single version (e.g. <code>0.3.0</code>), a range of versions (e.g.
<code>"&gt;=1.2.1 &lt;2.0.0"</code>), or <code>any</code> (or just empty) to specify that any version is
allowed.</p>

<p><a href="#library-package">Library packages</a> should always specify version constraints
for all of their dependencies, but <a href="#application-package">application packages</a>
should usually allow any version of their dependencies, since they use the
<a href="#lockfile">lockfile</a> to manage their dependency versions.</p>

<p>See also documentation on <a href="dependencies.html#version-constraints">version constraint
formatting</a> and <a href="versioning.html">the philosophy behind
Pub&rsquo;s versioning scheme</a>.</p>
