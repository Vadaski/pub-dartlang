// 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
// 2. Document all hacks fully:
//   a. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//   b. Why was this needed?
//   c. How does this fix it?
//   d. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then
//    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
// 4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
//   a. Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual
//      sprint time to it.

// a. Applies to clicking navigation in side-bar to go to an anchored element.
// b. When anchors are clicked, the page moves so that the top of the anchored
//    element is at the top of the viewport, but is concealed by fixed header.
//    The actual height of the navbar is a little wonky, and is NOT simply
//    $navbar-height.
// c. This forces the top of the anchored element to appear lower in the
//    viewport without changing its position in the page.
// d. If we had a better computed height for navbar, we could replace rvalue
//    with the computed value.
@mixin fixed-navbar-anchor-shame($navbar-height) {
  padding-top: $navbar-height + 20;
  margin-top: -($navbar-height + 10);
